But I feel like I need to close the loop on the newsletter.\nI saw this tweet yesterday that did a good job summing up how I feel:\nit\u2019s so mean that for 7.5 months you\u2019re conditioned to use the Phillies as a nightly distraction from pain and then when they\u2019re the cause of the largest amount of it they\u2019re not there anymore\nphixated on X\nx.com\nI don\u2019t have much more to say yet. We love the Phillies and they didn\u2019t seem to give it their best when it mattered most. i suggest we all take some time to chew on it, process, reflect, drink yourself to sleep, etc.\nFor now, a couple questions:\n1. Does this newsletter continue in 2024?\n2. Do I send a final \u201c2023 year in review\u201d newsletter?\nFeel free to send me some feedback as well\u2026\nHere are things that I would welcome as feedback:\n1. You didn\u2019t send the newsletter at a consistent time\n2. It\u2019s weird that you chose an ellipses run on sentence format at the beginning and then never changed it, there has to be a better way to do this\n3. It\u2019s weird it\u2019s one continuous reply all email, it\u2019s literally slowing down my phone and email inbox, there has to be a better way to do this\n4. Your grammar is akin to a 13 year foreign exchange student\u00a0\n5. Please proofread, just once in awhile\u00a0\nHere are pieces of feedback that will fall on deaf ears:\n1. You\u2019re a good for nothing piece of shit\n2. They made too many Shreks. Three was enough\n3. You moved from Philly because you couldn\u2019t stand the sight of Brad falling in love with someone else\n4. The Phillies should trade Kyle Schwarber\nThat\u2019s a wrap!\nSent from my iPhone"

    "body": "8/18 game vs Washington Nationals\nOnly way to describe last nights game was \u201cYikes\u201d\u2026in his first start since his NO HITTER earlier in the month\u2026Michael Lorenzon was batted around and beat up\u2026Phillies lost the game if you can\u2019t tell\u20268-7\u2026.The Phillies scores 6 runs in the 4th inning via Realmuto and Cave RBI doubles, a Danny Rojas single, and a Schwarbomb\u2026.but then the very next inning Lorenzon let up 6 runs of his own\u2026.Hoffman, Soto and Covey pitched in relief\u2026did a pretty good job allowing only one run\u2026.it was a frustrating game where the Phillies left a lot of runners in scoring position\u2026oh and I almost forgot the 6 run inning against Lorenzon could have been mitigated A LOT of Johan Rojas didn\u2019t drop a routine fly ball\u2026.\nIt\u2019s been a while, here are some Peet\u2019s Deets:\nPeet\u2019s Deets 1: I am not sold on Rojas. I would like Marsh to come back from Injury\u2026where is Christian Pache?\nPeet\u2019s Deets 2: The nationals have like the third best record in the NL since June apparently\u2026they have a bad overall record but are better than what their record reflects\u2026\nPeet\u2019s Deets 3: Topper had a bad game last night. He should have taken Lorenzon out earlier in the 4th\u2026.I love Topper, he is PaPa, but \u00a0he fucked that up imo\nPeet\u2019s Deets 4: down 8-6 in like the 7th (maybe 6th? Can\u2019t remember) Trae Turner was up with the bases loaded and struck out. \u201cYikes\u201d\nRecord: 66-56\nStandings: 2nd in NL East; 1st in NL WC\nNext up: Saturday 8/19 @ 4:05 vs WAS Nationals\u00a0\nSent from my iPhone"
